##Objectives

* Describe arguments as they relate to functions.
* Predict values returned by a given function.
* Apply programming skills to plan and build applications.

##Agenda

* Reivew Functions and Returns
* Function Practice
* Temperature Calculator Pseudo Code
* Temperature Calculator Lab
* Lab Time

##Function Review

```
function sayHello(name) {
    console.log('Hello ' + name);
}
```

* Declare a function using the `function` keyword to indicate you are making a function.
* The name (`sayHello`) should begin with a lowercase letter and use lowerCamelCase.
* The parameter is in the parentheses (`name`). It's a placeholder for a value provided when we call the function.
* The recipe for your function goes in bewtween the { }. Every line of code in this block must end with a ;.
* Run the code by calling the function `sayHello("Chris");`

---
##Function Returns

*	When we call a function, we don't always want to just print stuff or change CSS.
*	If we `return` a value, we can then use it (ie. the output from the function) in other code.
*	The `return` keyword simply gives the programmer back the value that comes out of the function.
*	When a function runs, and when the return keyword is used, the function will immediately stop running and return the value.

---
##Console.log()

*	Displays the contents of what is being logged in the console.
*	Useful for debugging and checking that the steps of a function are working correctly.

---

##event.preventDefault()

*	A user interaction can trigger events - clicking on a link, submitting a form
*	Many events have a naitive action associated, ex. clicking a link loads a page.
*	event.preventDefault() prevents these actions from happening.
