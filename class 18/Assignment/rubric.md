#FEWD Week #10 Project: Forms

---


###Description


This week, you'll be practicing your form skills by building a form for Relaxr. The form you build must include at least three different types of HTML form elements and some light CSS styling. We have given you an example of a form that renders well on the web and mobile devices, as well as an example, with starter code, of a registration form you could build for Relaxr.
