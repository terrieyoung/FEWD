Complete Spec: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input>

*  Gotchas
   *  The font-family for an input is not inherited!!!
   *  This can lead to funny sizing issues on Macs vs. PCs where the default font is not the same

##Submit vs File vs Button

*  Value is button text. Defaults to submit in chrome, submit query in IE ```<input type="submit" value="Submit">```


*  Creates a file upload element ```<input type="file">```


*  Creates clickable button ```<input type="button">```

##Select and Option

##Labels

Information about the input field should be put in a ```<label>``` tag

To tie the two together choose one of these methods:

```
<label>Name <input type="text" name="yourName"></label>
```

```
<label for="yourName">Name</label>
<input type="text" name="yourName" id="yourName">
```

Note:
Usability
Clicking the label text in either case places the focus in the input field (great for radio buttons)

---

##Styling

*  Can't be styled directly
   *  Checkboxes, File upload inputs, Radio buttons

*  Number of ways to do this 
   1. Opacity 0 on the element, set it's height and width to define clickable area, set the height and width of it's parent to be the same as the input (donâ€™t forget position relative). Style the parent.
   2. Hide the element, style a corresponding label how you wanted the element to appear
   3. Try using pseudo elements and the selector :checked for no JS switching between checked and unchecked images used for styling

---

Fieldset/Legend

```
<fieldset>
Wrapper for grouped form elements
Ex: First, middle, last name text fields
<legend>
Goes inside fieldset
Defines the grouping term for the fieldset
<fieldset>
   <legend>Your Name</legend>
   <input type="text" name="first_name">
   <input type="text" name="middle_name">
   <input type="text" name="last_name">
</fieldset>
```
