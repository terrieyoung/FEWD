## Grids

#### What is a grid system?

A collection of css styles that allow you to quickly put together a responsive columned layout.


It's a structure that allows for content to be stacked vertically and horizontally consistently and easily manageable. Grids are project-agnostic giving it a high degree of portability.

#### What are the components?

* Rows - accommodate the columns.
